Library Management System (LMS) in Java

Overview:
The Library Management System (LMS) is a Java-based application that provides a comprehensive solution for managing a library's collection of books, magazines, and newspapers. This system allows librarians and library staff to efficiently catalog, track, and organize library items, making it easier for patrons to access and borrow materials.

Key Features:

    Item Classification: The LMS supports various types of items, including books, magazines, and newspapers, each with its own set of attributes. Items are categorized and identified by a unique ID.

    Item Creation and Editing: Librarians can easily add new items to the library by specifying details such as title, author, publication date, and more. Items can also be edited or updated as needed.

    Item Deletion: Librarians can remove items from the library's collection when necessary. This feature helps keep the catalog up to date.

    Item Display: The system provides a user-friendly interface to display the details of library items. Patrons can search for items by title, author, or unique ID.

    Support for Multiple Item Types: The LMS accommodates different types of library items, such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Each item type has its own set of attributes and methods.

    Data Persistence: Library data is persisted by saving it to a text file. This ensures that the library's catalog is preserved even when the application is closed and reopened.

How to Use:

    Adding Items: To add a new item to the library, librarians can enter the title, type (book, magazine, or newspaper), and relevant details (e.g., author, publication date). Depending on the item type, additional information may be required, such as author names for magazines or publication dates for newspapers.

    Editing Items: Librarians can edit existing items by specifying the item's unique ID. They can modify details such as title, type, author, and publication date.

    Deleting Items: To remove an item from the library, librarians can provide its unique ID. This action will remove the item from the catalog.

    Displaying Items: The LMS provides options to view all items in the library, view a specific item by its ID, or search for items by title or author.

Technical Details:

    Language: Java
    Data Persistence: Library data is saved to and loaded from a text file, ensuring data continuity.
    Object-Oriented Design: The system is designed using object-oriented principles, with classes for items (e.g., books, magazines) and a Library class to manage the collection.

Usage:

This Library Management System is designed to streamline the management of library resources, making it easier for librarians to maintain an organized and up-to-date catalog. It provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for both library staff and patrons.
